1. The python code to run problem1a is AR_TAG_FFT.py.
2. The python code to run problem1B is AR_TAG_DET_DEC.py.
3. The python code to run problem2a is IMG_SUP_AR_TAG.py.
4. The python code to run problem2b is CUBE_AR_DET.py.
5. The PDF file of the report for the project is JAYESH_ENPM673_HW1.pdf.


AR_TAG_FFT.py detects the AR tag using FFT based on which matplotlib plots are generated.
AR_TAG_DET_DEC.py detects the AR tag along with binary and deimal value for all the videos.
IMG_SUP_AR_TAG.py superimposes the testudo.png on the AR tag.
CUBE_AR_DET.py projects a vrtual cube on the AR tag
